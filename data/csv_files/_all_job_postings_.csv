Replicating the same taste of its Hong Kong counterpart, it was an unbridled success. Its opening saw long lines at all hours and intense media attention. Tim Ho Wan quickly became a household name. With its combination of quality and affordability, Tim Ho Wan won over the taste buds of discerning and value-conscious Singaporeans to be the top dim sum restaurant in Singapore. More restaurants in Singapore opened over the years to cope with demand. Local devotees can savour the famed Baked Bun with BBQ pork – one of the dishes that gained Tim Ho Wan its success and international following.With its successful overseas foray to Singapore and now-proven replication of its award-winning taste out of Hong Kong, Tim Ho Wan expanded into more countries. Our dim sum in Singapore continues to earn the plaudits of food critics and the hearts of epicureans well beyond Hong Kong.Tim Ho Wan currently has more than 60+ restaurants worldwide.","We are looking for a HR Assistant to help us with our daily tasksResponsibilities:· Assist in handling a full spectrum of HR and general administrative matters for the HR department· Maintain accurate records of staff particulars in the HR system, check and report any discrepancies· Physical and E-filing of employees’ P-files· Process work pass applications, renewal and cancellations and liaise with the Ministry of Manpower for work pass-related issues· Assist with monthly payroll· Prepare necessary documents for new hire, confirmation, etcRequirements:· Diploma in Human Resource Management or equivalent· Proficient in English and Chinese· Team player with a positive attitude and proactive· Organized and meticulous in documentation"
